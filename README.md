# IDS Angular UI Kit

IDS Angular is an open source component collection for Angular applications implementing the i-Cell Design System. The styling is token based (CSS variables) and is separated from this package (see [@i-cell/ids-styles](https://github.com/i-Cell-Mobilsoft-Open-Source/ids-styles)).
